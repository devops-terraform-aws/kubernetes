Probes:
  - liveness probes:  Check wether container is up or not. spin up a pod (sping an application inside), applicvation needs time to come up. Defined in spec section
    intialDelaySeconds: after how much time applying to check if applciation is up.
    periodSeconds : after how many sec to check if container is alive
    failureThreshold:  after * sec it didn't recieve request, will declare it gone
  - readiness probes: check whether my pod/container is ready to serve the traffic or not
  - startup probes: used for the application which follows gRPC protocol

readinessProbe: #This probe will check, whether your pod/container is ready to serve the traffic or not
        readinessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /readinesscheck.txt
            port: 80
          initialDelaySeconds: 5
          periodSeconds: 5
          failureThreshold: 24
          successThreshold: 1

livenessProbe: #This will check whether my contanier is up or not
        livenessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /livenesscheck.txt
            port: 80
          initialDelaySeconds: 10

Labels:

Selectors:

Service: Internet - svc - pod


NodeName: To schedule where to run container on pod


resources: Resctricting pods from consuming resources ( nwithin spec)
  requests


NodeAffinity:  When we schedule application to run on pod, and not enough resources, it will run on another pod

Taint (node) and Toleration(pod): will try to resstrict the pods to get scheduled into pods
