Questions:
- Docker max depth issue -  As the number of images increases, so does the local storage, resulting in the error: max depth exceeded. The maximum depth does not indicate a storage-capacity error. Instead, it indicates that the api image we were creating had too many layers.

Headless Service:
 Trying to access kubernetes cluster  through service ( what ever pod am having it will acess them)
  When it comes write it directs specific databse

  When it is read direstcs to all the database

Statefulsets: Manages pods that are based on identical specs -  They are not interchangeable. Spindud when we have a persistent volume

  No gaurantee of storage deletion
